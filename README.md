# A variety of unicode throbbers / animations

This is a shell script, relying on sleepenh(1) for timing accuracy and
animation smoothness. 

I use characters from many places in unicode, local font support is out of my control. 

Smooth animation not guaranteed, especially over slow or laggy networks.
